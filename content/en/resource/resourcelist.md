- [EntFA:](https://github.com/mcao516/EntFA) a toolbox for hallucinated entity detection in text generation. 

- [FactCorr:](https://github.com/mcao516/Factual-Error-Correction) a toolbox for post-processing scripts that directly edit text summarization outputs for factual error reduction. 

- [HipoRank:](https://github.com/mirandrom/HipoRank) unsupervised and extractive long document summarization model with hierarchical and positional information.

- [EditNTS](https://github.com/YueDongCS/EditNTS) an edit-based method for text and sentence simplification.  

- [BanditSum](https://github.com/YueDongCS/BanditSum) an extractive summarization algorithm trained with reinforcement learning with the setup of contextual multi-armed bandits.

- [HierClass](https://github.com/koustuvsinha/hier-class) a deep hierarchical neural attention-based classifier for hierarchical taxonomy datasets.

 
## Dataset
