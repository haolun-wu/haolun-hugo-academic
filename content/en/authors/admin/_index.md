I was born and grew up in [Chengdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu) üêºüå∂üÄÑüçµüç∂, a comfortable and tasty city with a 4,000-year history of human habitation. I spent my first 18 years in my hometown before traveling to different places around the world.

I am now a Ph.D. candidate at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/about/history) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) (one of the world's largest AI communities founded by [Yoshua Bengio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kukA0LcAAAAJ&hl=en)). 
I am delighted in working with [Xue (Steve) Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rfLIRakAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Fernando Diaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=212SLn0AAAAJ&hl=en).
I also collaborate closely with [Laurent Charlin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Cul0g2YAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Joelle Pineau](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=CEt6_mMAAAAJ&hl=en), and have them on my supervisory committee.
My research interests include knowledge modeling, storage, and retrieval in information systems, and also the alignment to social good.
I am honored to hold the [Borealis AI Fellowship](https://www.borealisai.com/news/the-borealis-ai-2022-2023-fellowships-fostering-next-gen-research-talent/).
